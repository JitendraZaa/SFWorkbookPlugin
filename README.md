### UI Comparison Between Orgs (üöß Work in Progress)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATUS: DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS**

This command is being developed to compare UI layouts between two Salesforce orgs to ensure field consistency, sequence, and layout match between environments (e.g., sandbox vs production).

**Intended Use Case:**
Compare Lead record UI between source and target orgs to verify:

- Field presence and sequence
- Section organization
- Field labels and types
- UI layout consistency

**Current Implementation Status:**

- ‚úÖ SOQL-based record selection (eliminates list view dependency)
- ‚úÖ Direct record navigation using record IDs
- ‚úÖ Robust URL construction for various Salesforce domains
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lightning field extraction in development
- ‚ùå Org comparison logic not yet implemented
- ‚ùå Comparison report generation pending

**Test Command (Single Org):**

```bash
sf jz uicompare --target-org myorg --dry-run
```

**Planned Features:**

- **Dual Org Comparison**: Compare UI layout between source and target orgs
- **Field Sequence Validation**: Ensure fields appear in same order
- **Layout Consistency Check**: Verify section organization matches
- **Difference Reporting**: Generate detailed reports of UI discrepancies
- **Multi-Object Support**: Extend beyond Lead records to other objects
- **Cross-UI Compatibility**: Support both Lightning and Classic interfaces

**Known Limitations:**

- Currently only attempts single-org data extraction
- Lightning field extraction needs refinement
- No comparison logic implemented yet
- Limited to Lead records in current implementation

**Development Notes:**

- SOQL query successfully finds Lead records
- Direct navigation working correctly
- Field extraction requires enhancement for modern Lightning UI
- Comparison algorithm and reporting engine pending implementation

### Permission Sets Export

## Development Workflow

### Build Commands

```bash
# Main build command (compiles TypeScript + runs lint)
yarn build

# Just compile TypeScript
yarn compile

# Run linter only
yarn lint

# Run tests
yarn test
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Clean build artifacts
yarn clean
yarn clean-all

# Format code
yarn format

# Watch mode (auto-compile on file changes)
yarn compile --watch
```

### Command Equivalents

| **npm command**   | **Yarn equivalent**      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| `npm install`     | `yarn` or `yarn install` |
| `npm run build`   | `yarn build` ‚ú®          |
| `npm run compile` | `yarn compile` ‚ú®        |
| `npm run test`    | `yarn test` ‚ú®           |
| `npm run lint`    | `yarn lint` ‚ú®           |

### Why Yarn?

- **Faster installs** (parallel downloads)
- **Shorter commands** (`yarn build` vs `npm run build`)
- **Better caching** and dependency resolution
- **Consistent dependency versions** with `yarn.lock`

## Code Analysis

Run Salesforce Code Analyzer for additional code quality checks:

```bash
sf code-analyzer run --output-file "codeAnalyzer/results.csv"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Plugin changes not reflecting:**

   - Ensure code is compiled after changes: `yarn build`
   - Use watch mode for auto-compilation: `yarn compile --watch`

2. **Git commit issues with Husky:**

   - Remove Husky checks if needed: `rm -rf .husky/`

3. **Dependency issues:**

   - Clear cache and reinstall: `yarn clean-all && yarn install`

4. **Memory issues with large logs:**

   - The plugin includes memory optimization and garbage collection
   - Use smaller batch sizes for log processing if needed

5. **Excel generation hanging:**

   - Cancel the operation and run again
   - Ensure sufficient system memory for large datasets

6. **Permission set comparison issues:**

   - Ensure both orgs are accessible and authenticated
   - Some permission differences may be expected between sandbox and production environments
   - Standard permission sets are typically identical and can be excluded with the default behavior

7. **Email templates package.xml issues:**

   - Ensure templates have valid folder references (unfiled$public is default for unorganized templates)
   - Use dry-run mode first to verify template names and folder structure
   - Generated package.xml includes fully qualified names (folder/template) required for deployment

8. **UI Compare issues (üöß Work in Progress):**
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Feature incomplete**: UI comparison is currently under development and may not produce expected results
   - **Field extraction**: Lightning UI field extraction needs enhancement - currently returns empty sections
   - **Single org only**: Command currently only processes one org; dual-org comparison not yet implemented
   - **Limited object support**: Currently limited to Lead records only
   - **No comparison output**: Comparison reports and difference analysis not yet available
   - **SOQL working**: Record selection and navigation working correctly
   - **Use dry-run**: Use `--dry-run` flag to test command setup without browser automation
   - **Development status**: Command foundation is solid but field extraction and comparison logic pending

### Performance Tips

- Use dry-run mode first to estimate processing time for log operations
- Use smaller batch sizes for orgs with many debug logs
- Choose specific permission sets instead of exporting all when possible
- Use text format for health reports if Excel generation is slow
- For permission set comparisons, specify individual permission sets rather than comparing all when possible
- Permission set comparisons use parallel processing automatically for better performance
- Use dry-run mode with email templates to preview results before generating package.xml files
- Filter email templates by specific types when you only need certain template categories
- UI Compare is currently under development - use dry-run mode for testing
- SOQL-based record selection eliminates list view filter dependencies (working correctly)
- Direct record navigation provides reliable access (implemented and working)
- Field extraction and comparison logic still in development
